From Minnesota, via California, now New York. I’m always learning, and I often think most things should slow down a little. I’m still working on that practice for myself. I’ve been a tech nerd since my teens in the 1990s, but didn’t begin to take it seriously until around 2009. (The 73k is like tek, like tech, like Piontek ... get it? No? OK.)

I enjoy spending time with my pets, going hiking, connecting with nature, anthropology, philosophy, spirituality, and tinkering with programming projects.
