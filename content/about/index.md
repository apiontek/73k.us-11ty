From Minnesota, via California, now New York. I’m always learning, and I often think most things should slow down a little. I’m still working on that practice for myself. I’ve been a tech nerd since my teens in the 1990s, but didn’t begin to take it seriously until around 2009.

I enjoy spending time with my pets, going hiking, connecting with nature, anthropology, philosophy, spirituality, and tinkering with programming projects. Find me on [Mastodon](https://kolektiva.social/@adampiontek), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adampiontek), [Github](https://github.com/apiontek), [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2450014-adam-piontek), [Facebook](https://facebook.com/damek), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/adampiontek/), even [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@adampiontek8) — and get my [public GPG key](/DF185CEE29A3D443_public_key.asc).

This site is powered by [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) & [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/), on a little hosted VPS that also runs [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app/), [Mealie](https://hay-kot.github.io/mealie/), [Gitea](https://about.gitea.com/), [ZNC](https://znc.in/), [Dashy](https://dashy.to/), and a self-made shift-worker scheduler I wrote in elixir.

On a spry little Celeron J6412 box at home, I run [magicmirror](https://khassel.gitlab.io/magicmirror/), [Calibre-Web](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web) and [BicBucStriim](https://projekte.textmulch.de/bicbucstriim/), [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/), and a few other things. And I have the pleasure of [OpenWrt on a thriving Edgerouter 4](/blog/openwrt-on-ubiquiti-edgerouter-4-er-4).

Also, the 73k is like tek, like tech, like Piontek &hellip; nevermind.
