Sometimes things are a little more complex than we'd like and require more nuance than simple, ingrained cultural narratives might allow by default.

It's been almost a year since a significant relationship of mine ended. Some things I think I've learned or figured out, from what happened:

* * *

To varying degrees, I have felt, as regards some relationships throughout my life, "I _need_ this person/relationship, in order to accept and love myself." Not consciously - I wasn't aware of it at a level where I would think about it and act from it mindfully, but it was how I felt underneath. I couldn't, or didn't know how to, love myself and accept myself, so I sought that externally.

Acceptance and love are, basically, fundamental human needs. If you're only getting that externally, you want to be in control of it. You fear losing it. The idea of your source going away or changing in unexpected ways — it feels almost like the threat of death. A loss of one's self.

* * *

Learning to love myself and accept myself — like, for real — takes time. It involves allowing feelings I may be confused about.

Feelings are bringing messages we may not always be able to hear or understand right away. But we definitely won't get the message if we ignore or subdue the messenger.

* * *

I have come to accept I will never fully understand what happened.

I _think_ the other person was trying to tell me, basically, they didn't really want what I wanted, and they were craving some change in a different direction. That ought to be fine, but ... well, they weren't clear about it, and I was too fearful and reactive to ask for clarity. I tried to figure it out on my own and control the situation.

And so they set a boundary with me.

This has also brought me some anger. And a desire to set my own boundary.

I've had sadness. Many different kinds, of course. One is a sadness that "I didn't get to say goodbye." Or, perhaps another lost option: "We didn't get to mutually say goodbye and/or transmute our relationship into something new and different."

And the nuance here involves: first, I am partly responsible for that, so I've experienced anger with myself. I acted in a way that caused them to feel the need to set a boundary and hard-separate. But second, they are also responsible, they chose to hard separate and I also experience anger toward them about that.

* * *

I don't really have any big conclusions here. I just felt like writing out these, well, sort of "clear" realizations that don't feel great but are what they are:

It doesn't feel good that someone needed to set a boundary with me, but I can understand it and recognize it. It doesn't feel good that, due to that choice, there couldn't be any, like, proper "goodbye" or whatever.

But what can I do? I must accept myself, my past, where I am, where I've been. I must love myself. I must forgive myself.

I begin to feel the capacity to forgive them. I don't want to carry that on my back anymore.

And as part of that, I feel my own boundary well up. I don't really want to have to deal with them ever again.

Because the truth is, while I played a part in what happened, it also grew out of years of waiting for this person to figure out what the heck they wanted. And after years, they were finally figuring out that they didn't really want what I wanted, and they could barely tell me with any clarity. It's maddening.

* * *

Because another big lesson I've learned is:

I knew it.

I KNEW IT.

There was a part of me that knew for a long time that I deserved clarity, I deserved to know where we stood, I deserved to be spending my time with someone who knew what they wanted and knew they wanted to be with me and share with me, and it was, like, 8 fucking years of confusion and uncertainty, and her holding her feelings and thoughts close to her chest.

I made excuse after excuse and ... if I _really did love and accept myself_ ... I might have felt able to set a boundary years ago. "I don't know what you want, and based on the choices you've made it feels like you don't want what I thought we all wanted, and I think maybe we should take some time apart so you can figure out what you're looking for."
