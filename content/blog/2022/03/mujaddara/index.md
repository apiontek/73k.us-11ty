This is so satisfying, and so simple. Kat has often made it, but I finally had reason to do it. Saving here for reference, this is based off [this recipe at food52](https://food52.com/recipes/8565-mujaddara-with-spiced-yogurt).

So, you're going to make three things, and when they're all done, you're going to mix them all together.

### _Rice_

Simple enough. I just did 2 cups rice in the rice cooker. Wash the rice. (Also, when you wash the rice, wash the rice (per Edward Espe Brown)). For cooking, I did 1 tsp salt, and enough water to cover the rice to my first knuckle (if the tip of your finger is touching the top of the rice in the rice cooker). When it's done it can just sit there.

### _Lentils_

Again, doubling the reference recipe, I did 1.5 cups pardina lentils. Kat gets them from [Palouse Brand](https://www.palousebrand.com/). Pardina lentils aren't the most common you can usually find in grocery stores, but sometimes you can. In a pinch, we once found Goya pardina lentils at our local C-Town (but also, screw Goya).

Anyway, 1.5 cups pardina lentils, about 6 cups water, 1 tsp salt, set over medium heat, and bring to a boil. Unlike the referenced recipe, I didn't finish in the oven, I just put it to simmer once boiling and watched it, testing the lentils now and then to try to hit the sweet spot where they're just pleasantly soft, not mushy.

When done, drain and set aside.

### _ONYO_

Here I was less familiar with the process so I more closely followed the reference recipe, but doubling:

- 4 tablespoons butter
- eh, olive oil? 6-ish tablespoons olive oil I guess?
- 10-12 cups onions (about 6 medium onions), halved and thinly sliced

Set a wide, deep saute pan over medium-low heat and add butter and, eh, 3-4 tablespoons olive oil maybe. When butter has mostly melted, add onions and toss to incorporate with butter and oil. (And, note from Kat, "next time salt the onions a little" ðŸ˜…)

After 5 minutes (maybe longer since we doubled the quantity), onions will have softened slightly and started to release their liquid. Raise heat to medium and cook 10 to 12 minutes more, until onions are very soft and browned (again, maybe longer for the doubled qty). Add water by the tablespoon if pan gets too dry or if onions start to stick. When onions are well browned, add last tablespoon of olive oil and raise heat to high. Cook another 3 to 4 minutes, until bottom layer of onions has charred and crisped; try not to stir too much, or onions won't crisp up.

### _Assemble!_

Combine rice, lentils, and onions in large serving bowl and let sit for at least 15 minutes, to marry the flavors together, before enjoying. The dish also improves with age.
