Coming off several rounds of the [pumpkin baked oats concept](https://73k.us/blog/baked-pumpkin-banana-oats-breakfast-concept), some fatigue had set in, and a variation was called for.

For now we've settled on a version of this [pear baked oatmeal recipe](https://thestarphoenix.com/life/bridges/food-roasted-pear-baked-oatmeal-is-easy-and-impressive/), with some modifications.

The biggest one is that I do it more like what I've been doing previously, meaning the fruit is all mixed in. I basically cube the pears and mix it in with the other wet items. I like the pear more evenly distributed.

Also skipping the flax seeds, and the whole topping part, but otherwise it's basically the same:

- 2 cups rolled oats (or, as I'm still doing, the Kodiak Power Oats)
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp finely chopped fresh rosemary
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg
- 1/2 tsp ground cardamom (hell yeah)
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 2 large eggs
- 2 cups whole milk
- 1/3 cup maple syrup
- 2 Tbsp melted butter, plus some for pan
- 1 tsp pure vanilla extract
- 2 ripe pears, chopped into small cubes

Instructions basically the same as my other baked oats:

In one bowl, combine all the dry items. In another bowl, combine the wet items and whisk together.

Grease baking pan with some butter. Combine the wet & dry items and whisk together briefly, then pour into the baking pan.

These should bake longer than the others - I've been doing about 40min at ~330F.
