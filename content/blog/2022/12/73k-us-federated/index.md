UPDATE 2023-01-10: Well, that didn't last long. On some reflection and limited use, I realized there isn't really any reason to federate my _blog._ The experience isn't as good as it could be, and other reasons [better explored by Kev Quirk](https://kevquirk.com/does-a-blog-need-to-integrate/). You can follow the RSS feed, and beyond that, I like things simpler these days.

Original content of this post about the ActivityPub plugin for WordPress follows:

As federated social media picks up some steam, I experienced my old habitual thought of "I'll run my own server!" But such efforts take _effort,_ and I'm tired. The place I've made my home so far seems run pretty well and I'm having a nice enough time, why complicate matters?

That said, I was thinking it'd be nice if my longer-form writing could be federated ("Maybe I'd even write more!" Sure, sure...). And there is a [self-host option for that](https://writefreely.org/), but then there's a heavy lift in migrating content, trying to theme it, etc.

Then I discovered there's an [ActivityPub plugin for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/), which makes _so much sense,_ I just had to install it. It encouraged me to add a little author page support to my custom theme, at least, since that's the "profile."

Anyway, now for whoever cares, you can not only subscribe to a classic feed, apparently you can also now follow my writing here on Mastodon et al. -- and using [@adam@73k.us](https://73k.us/blog/author/adam) as the handle, no less! Pretty slick, in theory, but I have yet to see how this plays out in real-world experience.

In a way, this post itself is a test, since I subscribed to myself from my kolektiva.social account, and this is my first post after setting this up. Let's find out what happens!
