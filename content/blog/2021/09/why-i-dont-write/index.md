Why write something if it won't be definitive? Why write something if it's not perfect? If it doesn't address every point, or everything related to the topic? Or if it makes a good point but gets some other things wrong?

Why write if probably nobody will read it? Why write if even just one person who might read it might think they wasted their time?

Why write if I say something I later disagree with? If I change my mind about something, and my past thoughts are still out there?

Should not the marks I leave behind on the world be without fault?

Should not the product of my life be a pure, perfect expression of truth?
