For some people, when, say, an advertisement promises you'll feel "just like family," or a video game has in-game "messages from Mom," the emotions triggered are not pleasant or nostalgic, but fearful, or confused, or angry. The "family" we had growing up wasn't necessarily pleasant, supportive, or giving. Our parents may have been neglectful, absent, or affected in other ways that left deep marks on us.

In the support group [Adult Children of Alcoholics (ACA)/Dysfunctional Families](https://adultchildren.org/) there's a concept of "reparenting,"

Today I read the Aug 12 ACA daily reflection on this topic and felt waves of grief.

There's a tiktok sound people use for a lot of videos of a man's voice saying "Wow, I'm so proud of you! You're doing amazing! _Amazing!_" ... and it always makes me cry.

I don't think it's a coincidence that the original comes from a video of a child learning to ride a bike.

One of the few vague memories I have of my father's "normal" contributions to my life is of him helping me learn to ride a bike in the parking lot of my elementary school.

As I grew older, the effects of his brain aneurysm from earlier in his life grew more pronounced, and my mother's response to his disability grew more abusive and neglectful. And she made me her accomplice in her anger at him and his disability, so as a teen I wanted nothing to do with him.

The effects were mainly just memory loss, but my mother's treatment of him compounded everything. Most of what I didn't like about him as a teen came from the effects of my mother's anger and rejection of him.

Sometimes he would come to me to talk about something he thought I'd be interested in, and it's true that many teens might be annoyed, but I was doubly so because of this added frustration with him.

I look back now with great grief for my part in rejecting connection with him.

And great grief for the child in me who didn't have a supportive father, let alone mother.

But I'm also grateful to know now, decades later, how deeply these facts of my childhood, outside my power, wounded me. I can reparent myself.

For much of my childhood I felt a "pull" towards families I perceived as normal. As a teen this was largely suppressed and forgotten, but the desires remained. I look at some of the patterns of my "adult" life and see mainly unconscious attempts to create what might feel like a "normal family." I say "mainly unconscious" because there was some awareness of a desire for "chosen family," but I didn't really preceive from what or why this craving originated.

And, unfortunately, it doesn't necessarily work to enlist others into being your surrogate "healthy parents & siblings." It can satisfy for a while, but it's not fair to others and ultimately ends up recreating some amount of dysfunction and pain.

The true solution seems to be, as ACA suggests, to become your own loving parent.

I look back now at some of the desire I remember from childhood to be part of a "normal family" and as it resurfaces I imagine, "what would it have felt like to have had a 'normal' father? A healthy loving mother?"

And I can bring that to myself now. I can imagine a supportive, loving father and try to be that for myself.

And it feels good, and brings up more grief.
