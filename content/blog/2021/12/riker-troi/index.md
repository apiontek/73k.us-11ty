Sometimes I beat myself up for not having been as open to change in relationships.

The reality is that humans grow and change, and sometimes people who enter into relationship discover they no longer want the same things, or want different enough things that it's time to go different ways. To change the expectations of the relationship or "end" it.

I would prefer in future to be able to feel my feelings about such change, but also allow it, welcome it, go through transitions and transformations together with myself and those I love.

The relationship of Riker & Troi is an interesting model in this regard. They had a relationship in the past, but had to move on. Became good friends and colleagues.

One imagines they had an enlightened 24th Century human approach to the transition in their relationship. And I know I have not lived up to that in the past, and I want to do better.

But there are some important details to note.

It's suggested they couldn't say goodbye when they parted. And in one episode, we learn:

> The last time they saw each other, according to this Riker's memory, was on Betazed — the day before he started his tour on the Potemkin. Riker recalls that they were going to meet on Risa six weeks later. Troi interrupts him and tells him that they never did meet up in Risa. She tells him that he earned a promotion very quickly and chose to make his career a priority. There wasn't much time for anything else. They kept in touch, says Troi, but they didn't see each other again until they were both posted on the Enterprise two years later.

> from [Memory Alpha's page on the episode "Second Chances"](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Second_Chances_(episode))

It seems they have a sort of model "post-relationship friend/professional" relationship, but there was a sudden change, a lengthy break, and what we see on screen suggests Troi was interested in reconnecting, while Riker wanted to maintain some boundaries.

The other thing suggested here is that Riker pretty decisively knew where he wanted to go with his life. On receiving a promotion, he pursued that. Whether he communicated that to Troi, clearly or otherwise, isn't clear.

I find this of note because I can look at times I wish I'd done better — done as well as Riker & Troi at their best — but it seems even they didn't do "parting" perfectly, and to the extent that we don't know how it went, we do know that at least one of them was clear on what they wanted and took decisive action.

The times I've had difficulty with relationship change, I also see a lack — for both myself and/or my partner — of the kind of self-knowledge that leads to clear communication and decisive action.

_Of course_ I've reacted poorly at times when someone wasn't clear with me or dragged things out.

So, while I definitely want to do better for myself in that area, that must also include expecting better of others, and communicating as clearly as I can, or setting boundaries when my partners' behavior and communication isn't clear.
