In a meditation session yesterday, I suddenly felt a perspective shift, way outside of myself, and thoughts came to me like, "How strange and wonderful to be who I am, where I am. Sitting in New York City, in this house, in this sweatshirt, with these pets, and these chores. How did I get here?"

And a sense of wonder at the strangeness of our lives is good, sometimes, I think -- I mean, our lives are fleeting and in a sense we are all just unique manifestations of the raw awareness of the universe knowing itself.

But also, this clear answer to one part of my "question" also came to me: "I'm in New York because, after college, I didn't know who I was without the person I met in college."

More accurately, _I didn't know who I was without that relationship._

I mean, I loved her. And I moved here to be with her. Those things are true, and not unromantic. But with hindsight and growth, I also see that I grew up with a healthy dose of childhood neglect, and trauma, desperately needing to escape my home of origin, but so defined by it that I sought to escape by finding a relationship to latch on to and define myself anew.

Often, people are compatible until they're not. And that's normal and OK, but I didn't have a good relationship with that idea at the time. I sought to derive my sense of self -- of meaning, of purpose -- from my relationship -- from having a _good, happy_ relationship. And when my partner or I wasn't happy in our relationship, felt there was something wrong with me. Something wrong with how I was doing it.

I recently heard the metaphor of some people being moths, some butterflies -- and, like, when we enter a period of metamorphosis, we're compatible at the start because we're both crawling, but later, our needs are different. And that's ok.

And perhaps, also, we enter metamorphosis at different times. Or some of us drive ourselves sick because we're tired of crawling but we don't think we're supposed to change. We're afraid of change even as we crave it. So we don't let ourselves, and what we do to deny it or suppress it can cause us even more harm.

And sometimes we also choose poor alternatives to real change.

I defined myself by my relationship. The definition wasn't working for me anymore. But I was too ashamed of the need for change, I could barely communicate it.

When we finally managed to communicate enough to part ways, it was partly because I'd found a new set of relationships that I thought would serve me better.

In other words, I found a new outside source of validation and definition.

Which was great, for a time, but when I was mistreated or neglected, I ignored it or repressed it, because I **_NEEDED_** the relationships to continue or else, who was I?

Again, _I didn't know who I was without the relationships._

I was afraid to speak plainly about what I hoped for or wanted. Because I _**NEEDED**_ the relationship, and any risk at losing it sooner than later seemed more scary than keeping the relationship going even unsatisfactorily.

Ultimately, enough changed that one of the partnerships I was maintaining ... well, they decided it wasn't working for them anymore. And I was so invested in the idea of that relationship as central to who I was that it felt like death, a death I hadn't faced or been willing to accept. I argued with them, and they set a boundary and cut me out.

They could have been much more skillful and I've experienced some anger about that, but it's me I have to live with. I could have been far more skillful.

I'm sad I couldn't simply allow the change and say goodbye.

There could have been the possibility of grieving the relationship together and moving to a new stage, but my fear-driven, _need-_driven reactivity shut out that possibility.

I'm sad about that.

For a while I was focused on a sadness that I'd hurt them, an anger for how they'd hurt me -- that sort of thing.

But now this has moved on to something new:

I'm sad that I hurt myself for so many years by not simply taking the time to know myself. By defining myself by others for so long, and focusing on keeping them happy so they would keep validating me.

The biggest amends I owe truly is to myself. To get to know myself now, take care of myself, love myself.

And as scary or simplistic as it sounds: to get to a place where I don't _NEED_ other people in the same way.

Because a version of myself that accepts and validates my own feelings would have behaved much differently in all my past relationships. Pretty much every regret I have would have been served by a version of myself that was healthy, sober, present with my feelings and my needs, and setting boundaries of my own.

Because we were all caterpillars just crawling around, and I can't really blame others for making choices that hurt me which I nevertheless accepted and lived with instead of setting a boundary for myself.

Nobody's perfect. People will hurt me. I will hurt people. But I don't need to be actively hurting myself and participating in my own harm anymore.
