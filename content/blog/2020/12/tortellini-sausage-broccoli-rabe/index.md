Another good meal prep. We just use frozen cheese tortellini. Can use frozen broccoli, but broccoli rabe is preferred.

For the sausage, we prefer Premio Italian chicken sausage.

Cook the sausage and set aside. Cook the greens w/olive oil, garlic, salt, red pepper flakes. Slice the sausage into medallions.

When the greens have cooked down most of the way, add the sausage back and steam the tortellini on the bed of greens. Ok to add a little water if needed, frozen veg usually more watery than fresh.

It's done when the greens & tortellini are ready!
