Personal website of Adam Piontek, using the [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) site generator (using the [v2.0 release](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/eleventy-v2/)).

## Notes

This is based originally off the [eleventy-base-blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) project, with modifications over time to suit my needs, of course.

Syntax highlighting color theme is [Sara Vieira's prism port](https://github.com/SaraVieira/prism-theme-night-owl) of [Sarah Drasner's VSCode Night Owl theme](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme).
